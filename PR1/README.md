**Title:** Programming Assignment #1

The objective of this assignment is practicing with the classical search algorithms, which is BFS, IDS, and A*.
## Description
The goal of problem is moving from point (0,0) to the target point (X,Y), where X and Y are integers. A sequence of integers in the range of 0 ~ 9 are provided as part of input. In each step, you can choose to takes the next integer in the sequence and select an operation to move to a new point. There are five operations allowed (i.e., the branching factor b for the search tree is 5): X+, X-, Y+, Y-, and Stop. You should use BFS, IDS, and A* tree search algorithm to achieve the goal.
